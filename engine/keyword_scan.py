"""Keyword scanner and same-topic detector (v3).

Two independent retrieval signals that supplement the embedding pipeline:

1. KEYWORD SCAN: extract core disease terms and risk factors from the source
   article, then grep every page's stored body text for those phrases. This is
   what catches "alcohol" <> "stomach cancer" and every other obvious topical
   link the embedding model misses because it compresses domain vocabulary.

2. SAME-TOPIC DETECTION: pairwise Jaccard similarity on H1/title content words.
   Two stomach cancer articles always find each other, regardless of what the
   embedding says about individual paragraphs.

Both return candidate page URLs with scores that the orchestrator merges into
the main retrieval pipeline.
